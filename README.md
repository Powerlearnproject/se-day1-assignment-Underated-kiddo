#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

>Software engineering-is the systematic application of engineering principles and best 
        practices to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software.
         It uses toools , techniques and methodologies to create high quality systems that 
          meet the users needs and can help in solving issues in society.
      >importance:
        1. Ensures High-Quality Software- scalable , reliable and robust softwares are created 
           that meets user needs and expectations.
        2. Consistency and Efficiency- software engineering makes sure that the softwares 
           created is consistent in its data and efficient to minimise errors and redundancies.
        3. Scalability and Maintainability- software engineering ensures a system is build 
           with  scalability in mind because  system can grow and become more complex, it is 
           also  important to maintain these software for security perposes.
        4. Risk Management-Proactive risk management reduces the likelihood of costly 
           errors and system failures later on.Software engineering helps in identifying 
           potential risks early in the development process, including security 
           vulnerabilities, integration issues, or performance bottlenecks. 
        5. Collaboration and Communication- Software engineering encourages collaboration 
            among developers, testers, project managers, and clients.The technology industry 
            often involves large teams working together to develop complex systems.
        6. Adapting to Changing Needs- As user requirements evolve, the software can be 
          updated or redesigned to meet new demands and software engineering helps because it 
           allows  systems to be flexible and adaptive.
        7. Cost-Effectiveness- By using software engineering practices, companies 
           can avoid the inefficiencies that come with ad-hoc coding. Structured approaches 
           help reduce waste and improve productivity, making it more cost-effective in the 
           long term.
        8. Improves Security and Data Protection- software engineering practices ensure that 
           security is considered at every stage of development, from design to testing , 
           ensuring secure coding practices, encryption, and other protective measures help 
            safeguard user data and protect against potential threats.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

   1. The Emergence of the Software Crisis (1960s-1970s)
          Before the software engineering discipline emerged, software development was largely 
          an ad hoc process. Developers often wrote code in isolation, with little 
          consideration for long-term maintenance, scalability, or even standardization. As 
          computer systems grew more powerful and the demand for software increased, the 
          limitations of this approach became clear. The software crisis highlighted the need 
          for more formalized methods, tools, and practices to create reliable, maintainable 
          software.
        2. Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
          Structured programming emphasized the use of clear, well-defined control structures 
          such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines, eliminating the need for "goto" 
          statements that made code hard to read and maintain. Key figures in the development 
          of structured programming included Edsger Dijkstra, who advocated for structured 
          programming practices to improve software clarity and reduce errors.
        3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (1990s-Present)
         Agile methodologies emphasize flexibility, iterative development, and collaboration 
         between developers and stakeholders. The approach advocates for delivering small, 
         working increments of software on a regular basis, rather than waiting until the end 
         of a long development cycle to deliver the final product. Agile prioritizes customer 
         feedback, adaptive planning, and continuous improvement.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   
   1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis- this is the gathering of information and 
           requirements to help in building a software and how to solve a perticular problem.
       2. System Design- this is where a blueprint of the system is created addressing the 
           requirements. 
       3. Implementation- This is where the actual software is build.Developers start writing 
          code to implement the design that was made.        
       4. Testing-The code written is put through tests to fix/check bugs or emerging issues
           making sure the software meets the requirements specified.
       5. Deployment-After the software passes the testing phase, it is ready for deployment 
          to the production environment, where it will be used by the end-users. It si done in 
          stages depending on the softwares complexity.
       6. Maintenance- the software is monitered to ensure its continued functionality
       7. Retirement/End-of-Life (EOL)-This is where the software is no longer needed or a 
          newer version replaced it and at this point the system has to be dicomissioned.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  >   Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software 
      development. It is one of the most traditional methods and involves completing each 
      phase before moving on to the next while Agile methodelogy is an iterative and 
    incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. 
      Instead of a sequential process, Agile allows for ongoing iterations where the project 
        evolves through short, manageable cycles (called sprints).
  > Waterfall has ease of manage,clear structure and predictability while Argile has 
     flexibility , adaptability higher user satisfaction and faster feedback.
  > Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall are well defined projects and projects with strict 
    regulatory requirements  while for Argile are projects with evolving requirements,
    software development for dynamic environments and projects where fast time-to-market is 
    important.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

> Roles
  1.Software developer-is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that 
    powers software applications.
  2.Quality Assurance Engineer -is responsible for ensuring that the software meets the 
    required standards of quality before it is released.
  3.Project Manager-is responsible for overseeing the entire software development project, 
    ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and to the agreed-upon 
    specifications.
> Responsibilities
   1.Software developer - designing the software,writting code,debugging,unit testing and 
     version control.
   2.Quality Assurence Engineer - testing software ,test automation ,manual testing ,writting 
     test plans,bug reporting and ensuring compliance e.t.c.
   3.Project manager - planning and scheduling,resource management,risk management and 
     stakeholder communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> Importance of IDE - Enhanced Productivity-done by combining multiple tools in a single 
                       interface helping the programmer.
                    -Code Autocompletion and Suggestions- the IDEs can give suggestions while 
                     you are coding that aligns with what you are writting and can 
                       autocomplete the codes.
                    -Built-in Debugging- it can help you debugg by underlining areas with 
                      errirs with red lined and can take you to the place you have written a 
                      code bad.
                    -Error Checking and Code Quality-helps in error handling by suggesting a 
                      solution for your errors and how to fix them.
                    -Integrated Testing and Build Tools-helps in testing you code while 
                     running it .
                    - e.g: VS code,Pycharm,Eclipse e.t.c.
> Importance of VCS - Collaboration.
                    -Code History and Revisions-maintains a complete history of changes, 
                       including who made each change and why.
                    -Branching and Merging-developers can create branches of the code to work 
                      on new features or bug fixes independently from the main codebase  then 
                      afterwards can merge it to the main code.
                    -Backup and Recoveryand- Since VCS stores code in a centralized or 
                      distributed repository, developers can recover lost code from 
                       previous versions.
                    -Code Integrity and Accountability-VCS tracks every change made to the 
                      code, ensuring accountability..
                    -e.g: Git.Subversion,Perfomance and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  1. Managing Complex Codebases- can be ovecome by modular design,refactoring,code reviews 
        and automated testing.
    2. Handling Tight Deadlines and Time Constraints - can be overcome by Adopting agile 
        development practices,prioritizing features based on business value and complexity,
         using time management techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique to stay focused and 
          productive and avoiding perfectionism.  
    3. Communication and Collaboration-clear documentation,regular meetings and cross- 
       functional collaboration.
    4. Keeping Up with Evolving Technologies-Continuous Learning to keep up with evolving 
       tech,mentorship from experienced engineers.
    5. Debugging and Troubleshooting-use automated testing ,use version control to keep track 
      and isolating system parts to identify the part with the issue.    
    6. Balancing User Needs and Technical Constraints-maintain communications with 
        stakeholders,create prototypes to validate user requirements and have technical 
      feasibility.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
      
1. Unit Testing-  is the process of testing individual components or units of code 
                 in isolation, typically functions or methods, to ensure they work as 
                 expected. This is often performed by developers during the coding phase.
    >importance-Early detection of buggs and errrors,ensures code correctness,facilitate 
                refactoring and improves code quality.
    >Ensures that each component functions correctly, enabling developers to write code that 
       is reliable and maintainable.

    
2. Integration Testing-involves testing the interaction between different 
                  modules or components of the system to ensure that they work together as 
                   expected. It focuses on identifying issues in the interfaces or data flow 
                    between components.
   >importance-Reduces intergration problems,detects interface issues and verifies component 
       interaction.
   >Verifies that different parts of the system work together as expected, addressing problems that arise when combining components.
   
3.  System Testing-is a comprehensive testing process that verifies the complete and 
                   integrated system as a whole, ensuring that the system meets the specified 
                    requirements. This type of testing is conducted in a controlled 
                    environment that mirrors the production system as closely as possible.

   >importance- Ensures end-to-end functionaliy,validates requirements and detects critical 
    defects.
>Ensures that the entire system works as intended, meets the specified requirements, and behaves correctly in an environment that simulates real-world conditions.


4.  Acceptance Testing- is the final phase of testing, conducted to determine if the software 
           is ready for release. It ensures that the software meets the user's needs and 
           expectations. There are two main types of acceptance testing: Alpha testing 
         (conducted by internal testers) and Beta testing (conducted by external users).

   >importance-Ensures business requirements are met,user centric testing, final quality 
    assurance and reduced risk of failure.
>Confirms that the software meets the end user's expectations and business requirements, ensuring the software is ready for release and use in production.




   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

> Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing, refining, and optimizing the inputs (or "prompts") that are fed into AI models, to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and desired responses. 
 and its importance is as follows:

1. Optimizing Model Output-a well structured prompt gives better results than a poorly 
    structured prompt.
2. Improving Accuracy and Relevance- the more specific the prompt the more accurate and 
    relevant the results.
3. Enabling Task-Specific Responses-the more specific the prompt the  the less generic 
   response given by AI.
4. Making AI More Accessible- the models have been made easy to interact with even with  
  people with lesss tech knowledge by allowing users to interact with them in their natutral 
    language.
5. Reducing Model Errors- by reducing the the ambiguity of a prompt the response will not be 
   vague and there will not be  misunderstanding and or miss-interpretation.
6. Efficiency and Speed-effective prompts save on time and increase efficiency of responses.
7. Enhancing Creativity and Exploration- by experimenting with different promts you inspire the AI to generate creative responses.
   
 amoung others.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

>Vague Prompt- "Tell me about space."
>Improved Prompt-  "Can you explain the process of star formation in space, specifically how a 
                    nebula transforms into a star?"
The reason why the improved prompt is more effective is :
    >There is clarity and specification from the vage prompt that doesnt have any direction.
    >There is conciseness and packed with meaningful information that directs the conversation 
      in a focused way.
    >There is relevance because it will yield a targeted and relevance response.
    >It avoids ambiguity by focusing its responce on a well-defined aspect.
